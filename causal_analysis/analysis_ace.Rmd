We first use the Neyman's formula for calculating the ACE(X->Y) without accounting for any potential confounders. Here the variable Y is the delta5 column denoting the difference in headache severity score between baseline and 12 months and the variable X is the treatment group (binary).

```{r}
data_control = subset(data, group == 0)
data_treatment = subset(data, group == 1)

delta5_control = data_control$delta5
delta5_treatment = data_treatment$delta5

ace = mean(delta5_treatment) - mean(delta5_control)
print(paste('ACE(X->Y):', ace))
```
